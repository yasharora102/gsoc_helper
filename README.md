# GSOC Helper
This flutter app was built for the amFOSS hackathon by Team Prahlada boiz and it's members Anshuman Swain, Yash Arora and R.V.Rajagopalan.
The aim of this app is to make the process of participating in GSOC easier for students.
This app is suitable for beginners too as we suggest the best tech-stack that can be learnt on which most organization's projects are based, hence maximizing their chances of selection.
We have also built our own probability calculator that will help a student deduce his chances of getting selected for GSOC, which we calculate based on data collected from user and past GSOC data available.

## Tech Stack
We have built this project using FLutter so that it will enable us to deploy our source code for mobile-both Android and iOS, Web-app etc.
